# Introduction
The story is short. So, we are trying to find some application for both:
- Raman spectroscopy - the spectroscopic method using *Raman scattering* for non-destructive spectral information.
- Machine learning - the hideous technique of black-box phenomenological modelling designed for learning from statistical setting, of ungodly amount of data, and is typically very good.
- And one more old horse in this slot.
The horse can be anything worth considering. Pharma? Well, unfortunately we do not have expertise on it, so that goes out of the window[^2]. Either way, so far it can only go toward that. Currently, there is a traction toward going for material science, which is pretty nice by the way - since after all, it all lies in one single field, but I am pretty much worried about how we will fare with it, while there are at least a few other topics of interest that have similar characteristic, just to say, like material science.

Hence, that dictates what is available.

But oh well, let's see what can we do about this problem.
# A. The problem of criteria
Because it is multidiscipline, we have to make up the dimensional criteria analysis (a fancier name for *pick anything, but make it works fairly well for all things considered*) which satisfies the requirement of utilizing the physical technique (Raman scattering), the acting model (machine learning), and applying it to the topic of interest (still the old horse). 

So, what constitute the choices? Based on at least current knowledge, we can summarize them as followed.

| Raman spectroscopic method (Optical physics)       | Raman spectroscopy is fairly limited, in what can it affect. However, it is not limited in how can it be utilized. Certainly, for Raman scattering and spectroscopy, we need to know: <br>- What *type* of Raman spectroscopy are we talking about? Is it Resonance Raman (RRS), Surface-enhanced Raman (SER), or else? <br>- What *type* of data do we expect from those application or use cases? <br>- What is the interpretation of the experiment, the setting, and hence, the Raman scattering effect according to such setting?<br>- How hard it is to obtain a Raman sample (spectrum, etc.) for a given task? How much time do you have to make a sample, how much effort goes into it, how scalable is the sample acquisition process? Or rather, **how many data can we get, feasibly, and how easy can that be (or reverse)?**<br>- How many factors can be taken into account which might lead to sample degradation, sample contamination, etc. that ultimately affects how the experiment goes? <br>- How **costly** it is? What is the cost for operating them?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | The issue with interpretation is prominent. However, it seems like the general consensus focuses on the costs more so likely than that. Especially so, since a Raman spectroscopic unit is very costly (smallest one costs $4000). |
| Machine learning and artificial intelligence       | For machine learning, we have two approaches. Or rather, in the sense of *mathematical modelling*. Either **phenomenological** or **mechanistic** modelling can be performed. What does this means is that one is a *statistical* - purely observational without priori of knowledge about the mechanics behind it, and one models the mechanics of what operates under the curtain. By doing so, we set ourselves a fairly bit of requirements, for minimum: <br>- (Optional) A comprehensive study or availability to gain partial knowledge of the internal mechanics of the system in analysis (optical physics-specific knowledge might apply)<br>- Phenomenologically, settings and consideration of **large dataset**, **data availability**, **data interpretability**, and overall *how easy it is to analyze the data, gather the data*? <br>- Computational complexity: just how much will a certain task costs, and how can it be performed, either pre-training, or after-training? This will inevitably costs you application, for example, high computational complexity for edge device is undesirable. <br>- Architecture: What type of architecture, either phenomenological or mechanistic modelling will you use? <br>- Goal: What is the **intended goal**? Is the goal or final objective valid of applying machine learning? Are there any specific classical method that works well without using machine learning or artificial intelligence-aid method? <br>- Cost: How much will it costs, in operating, training, setting up? | The problem of cost is substantial, but not nearly as important as what of Raman spectroscopy.                                                                                                                                     |
| Certain topics (for now, it is *material science*) | Now, for certain topic, they have to satisfy all those above. Then comes down here for a bit of criteria. <br>- How much data and support that one specific topic has for both Raman spectroscopy and ML/AI? <br>- What has been done, what is the main angle of utilization the above topic used in the field? <br>- Does optical physics have places, or applications that can utilize specialized knowledge of optical physics in said field?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |


To full realize those criteria, we then have to analyze them, bit by bit. 
# B. Examining
So, we want criteria, and we want a topic. There's nothing much than just dive into it, I suppose. 
## I. Raman spectroscopy
Our first form factor is the main tool in the optical physics toolset of ours - **Raman spectroscopy**, which, is based on Raman scattering effect in contact of matters. Raman scattering is, again, an *optical* effect. Or, just so much saying that it is produced by shooting lights in some way, and get something in return. Most of the time, we get all of them back. Not so much of the time, we lose some, or we gain some. And in certain case, the difference is classified into Raman scattering, in which the information is packaged into seeing what we gain differently, how does it work, and what can be said using said difference. 

First, for Raman spectroscopy, its characteristic dictates what can we do with it. And to be honest, not so much. Raman spectroscopy as recalled, relies on **Raman scattering** effect, which is a non-destructive phenomenon on materials and matters. So is to say that it does practically nothing on the specimen we use to obtain the data, hence, it is pretty good and a nice choice for analysing stuff that you are concerned of that is not, well, suitable for being destroyed figuratively so much.

An interesting property of Raman scattering is the dual nature of it with IR spectrum. Under the vibration mode interpretation of Raman effect, some phonon (the vibrating 'packet') is IR-active while Roman-inactive, and so forth. Though, under a detailed analysis we can see that there are also *silent mode*, where both are inactive.

One of its main potential, from the early day when someone of the same name used solar ray to facilitate the effect is the *fingerprinting property* of Raman spectroscopic method. That is, any given matter will have its own **distinct** Raman spectrum. This leads to the application of *material identification*, *filtering*, *impurities classification (analysis)*, and else that make use specifically the property. Well, a lot of them. But there are also more than just that. Well, let's see for the most normal one.
### Types
While Raman scattering, in principle, is just the same, to obtain Raman-like spectrum, we developed a lot of methods. Those methods will dictates how and what type of spectral data we gain, and also the form of the system, especially the parameters of the given spectroscopic system if we are trying to do ML application - they need all the parameters. So, here goes.

| Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) | The development of coherent Raman microscopies came as a solution to the slow imaging inherent to spontaneous Raman scattering-based techniques.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Very fast imaging                                           | Costly, signal depends on concentration of $O(n^2)$ scale.        | No                     | Possible with more complex instrumentation                  |
| Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS)            | Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) describes a family of techniques first discovered and developed in the 1960s. SRS is a nonlinear technique that probes the same vibrational modes of molecules that are seen in spontaneous Raman scattering. While spontaneous Raman scattering is an incoherent technique, SRS is a coherent process, and this fact provides several advantages over conventional Raman techniques, among which are much stronger signals and the ability to time-resolve the vibrational motions.                                                                                                  | Very fast imaging, signal depends linearly on concentration | Costly                                                            | No                     | yes, but complex selection rules cause non-standard spectra |
| Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)     | There exists an enormous variety of approaches to SERS sensing, which has been applied across much of chemistry and materials science as well as the biosciences.<br><br>SERS measurements are often conducted on spontaneous Raman microscopes, as the major difference is simply the **Raman enhancement** applied to the sample itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Greatly enhanced signal                                     | High variability in spectra of endogenous molecules               | Yes, nanoparticles     | Yes                                                         |
| Tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS)         | TERS is inherently a hybrid optical/scanning-probe technique, relying on the ultra-precise positioning of a plasmonically-active nanoscale probe within a focused Raman excitation beam. Variations of this core concept involve different scanning probe microscopy (SPM) modalities, as well as different illumination configurations. <br><br>TERS typically samples volumes of the order of $1000\:nm^3$ thus most biological applications are targeted at separate macromolecular structures such as proteins, lipids and nucleic acids                                                                          | Greatly enhanced signal, sub-diffraction limit resolution   | High variability, tip durability                                  | yes, nanoparticles     | Yes                                                         |
| Spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS)   | Spatially-offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS) is based on the multiple diffuse scattering of light in turbid media (see more in [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-15601-4)).<br><br>Initial examples of SORS were performed on simple diffusely scattering powders with reasonably large Raman scattering (such as PMMA and trans-Stilbene. Most applications is in pharmaceutical science.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Depth-resolved spectra from turbid media                    | Poor resolution                                                   | No                     |                                                             |

| **FT-Raman** spectroscopy (FTRS)             | FT-Raman spectrometer uses a laser in the near IR - usually 1964 nm range. At such wavelength, the main advantage is that FT-Raman uses sensitive, single-element, near-infrared detectors like InGaAs, or Ge detector,An interferometer converts the Raman signal into an interferogram, permitting the detector to collect the entire Raman spectrum simultaneously. Since at low signal levels the spectral noise is predominantly detector dark noise and is independent of the intensity of the Raman signal, delivering the entire spectrum at once onto the detector greatly improves the signal-to-noise ratio. |                                                             |                                                                   |                        |                                                             |

# III. Non-ML Applications of Raman spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy is mentioned to be particularly effective, if not widely used in material sciences with their successes. We first review some of the general applications first, in which there are plenty. 




| Application              | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Inorganic and minerals** | Identification of purity or physical form of elemental carbon, germanium, sulphur, silicon from their *shape* and *bands* in the spectrum.<br>This can be used in plant control, pathological dust particulate identification, sample analysis, diamond quality checks, jade mineral surveys, etc. |
| **Art and archaeology**    | Non-destructive sample analysis is a key strength here. It also requires a very small sample—*microsample*—or can use confocal techniques.<br>This allows analysis of valuable or unattainable objects and the decomposition of such specimens. |
| **Polymers and emulsions** | A very early application. There's even a ten-chapter report on vibrational analysis of polymers using Raman spectroscopy.<br>Polymers have been studied for identification, structure, composition, curing, and degree of polymerization in solid, melt, film, and emulsion states.<br><br>Raman spectroscopy is also used to study polymer composites. |
| **Colour** | Surprisingly, Raman spectroscopy is *inherently weird* in that it's very sensitive to coloured molecules.<br>It can even overcome fluorescence effects when analyzing coloured molecules with visible light.<br>If you're into dyes or color science—this might be your thing. |
| **Electronics** | **Here's the fun part.** It's short!<br><br>Raman can be used in electronic devices for detecting or producing an image, making resonance Raman scattering a good color probe for electrophotography dyes.<br><br>Materials like phthalocyanine give off identifiable bands and are used in copier/printer drums, thin films, organic semiconductors, and LEDs.<br>Microscopic or *in situ* analysis is possible for studying these materials in actual devices.<br><br>Traditional semiconductors (carbon, germanium, silicon) are analyzed for quality control.<br>Semiconducting and superconducting crystals (like BSCCO or YBCO) can be structurally characterized using Raman spectroscopy. |
| **Forensic** | Catching crimes!<br>Modern Raman detection equipment makes it very useful in forensic science.<br>Why? Because it's non-invasive and non-contact. The rest follows. |
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        


Those are some typical normal application for Raman spectroscopy [^1]. Now, that is all good, but what about specifically *material science*? We found specifically some of the same interest. But what is the specific application for material sciences and its 'relating' in a sense field: Well, we identified several interesting application for a lot of them:

| Material science | Energetic materials<br>Amorphous materials<br> | Raman spectroscopy is especially useful in material sciences, for the following:<br>- Analysis of different material (Cantarero, 2014): Ge quantum wires, inorganic or organic materials; material identification of basic characterization, for example, in *amorphous materials* (glass, for example), or characterization of GaN quantum dots. More serious, advanced analysis setting is on the analysis of *layers material* (Ni et al. (2008), Sorkin (2014)) in, for example, bulk graphite (HOPG). In the context of **earth and material science** in conjunction, such materials in analysis expanded to *crystalline spectra* (Silicon's Silica polmorphs and amorphous SiO2), quartz, generally *amorphous materials*, aluminosilicate glasses, and else, are in the list. <br><br>- **Optical effects**: Materials can have various effect observable by Raman spectroscopy. For example, isotopic effect can be extracted meaningfully using Raman frequency [Windulle et al. (1999)] for Ge decomposition. Another effect observable is the *surface optical phonons*, where the bulk materials surface produces visible new phonon modes related to the surface, which plays a large roles for few layers of materials, or quantum wires of low-dimension. In such case, Raman can be used to extract meaningful information [Cantarero (2013), Moller et al. (2011)] about the TO, and LO phonon.<br><br>- **Electronic density** of states can also be analyzed, for doped semiconductor, which gives the *electron concentration* of a semiconducting material, for example, in a book chapter of Klein (1998) on GaAs. Silicon can be doped much more than such, and hence, another way for Raman spectra here to be observed, or extracted, is during the process of **energy concentration increment**: because then, at some point the electronic background will interferes with the phonon, and the shape of the phonon deviates from typical profile, giving the **Fano line-shape** for all kind of excitation spectra. This is more thoroughly studied in [Belitsky et al. (1997)] treatment on the theory of Raman scattering due to interaction of phonons with electronic background.<br><br>- **In situ Raman spectroscopy**: For material science, it is weirdly popular of a choice to include in situ Raman application. Not surprising afterward however, since *in situ* Raman spectroscopy can be performed at high temperature, high pressure, it can be used to investigate dynamic processes at high temperature or pressure, as reported by [Neuville et al. (2014)]. An illustrative example is shown by having boron oxygen coordinate being examined over high temperature changes. This perspective of time-series, multiple Raman layers also fits with what can be called **hyperspectral Raman imaging** as mentioned above. | Generally, Raman spectroscopy now is used in quality control, sensors, and else, instead of the classical usage of in-laboratory setting. |

To accomplish this, the focal volume is scanned across the sample, via either moving the optics or translating the sample itself. Each pixel is associated with a Raman spectrum.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                           |

Some conclusion are made from papers and experts on usage of Raman spectroscopy in those applications: 
1. The **obvious one** of why we are doing this topic: The lack of interactive database, or interpretation of large data. This is cited to be the main difficulties with Raman spectroscopy application, since the absence of such feature leads to difficulties with analysis and, again, interpretation of data. Furthermore, the data being interpreted is very *limited*, in a sense. For example, RRUFF database for mineralogical community is very useful, but also limited since one needs to have priori knowledge about chemical composition of the material to work on it. In situation in which that is hard to figure out, well... go figure. 
2. Aside from many types of Raman spectroscopic system, there is also the topic of **data interpretation**. We have mentioned the method of **hyperspectral Raman imaging**, in which an entire picture full of Raman spectrum as each pixel is at play. And there is also normal Raman spectrum, which is pretty much useful of all aspects. 
# II. Machine learning
Machine learning, specifically, the phenomenological approach that has been there since eternity (well, 1920s). On its own, the word **phenomenological** speaks it all - it use data, or rather, observations without knowing the internal mechanics (the *black-box* interpretation approach) to form model that mimic said behaviour observed given in the dataset. Often, the dataset $\mathcal{S}$ will typically be formed of criteria or assumptions, probability distribution, and other statistical descriptions. Generally speaking, they *learn from data*.

When working with machine learning models, usually, there is two types of widely used methods. First, is the *classical machine learning* models, or rather, models unrelated to the general scheme of neural network. And second, is the *deep learning model*, which obviously, formalize the neural network architecture to everything conceivable in the network. 



Well, see for yourselves why they would like to use more deep learning than classical - it is also proven, in certain cases, that deep learning model works better than classical setting. 

We only have a few concerns in such sense of operating and working with machine learning models. 
# C. Choices and viewport
We have some opinions and views. 
## C.1. Data availability
It is observed (Ewen, Geoffrey, 2005) that Raman spectroscopy is inherently expensive. Tradeoffs will happen with various techniques and spectroscopic setting, however, it is imperative to consider this beforehand. Data availability is indeed a problem, as taking into account the **time complexity** of acquiring samples, the amount of sample preparation and controlled sample setting, and overall, the cost of said sampling process is not cheap. 

To combat this, it is also observed from researches, that we can use either *quantum simulation* with potential aids from **quantum machine learning** model to synthetically create samples, based a small pool of sample as exemplary. More simply, we can use diffusions models, or any signal-processing model that can capture the relative, statistical intrinsic *property* of sample and its Raman spectrum, and hence applies noise (like Gaussian $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma)$) to synthetically generate sample of varied spectrum (retaining the characteristic, however). Such method, alongside with the perhaps adoption of few-shot learning and semantic capturing principles, might help in resolving said difficulties. Further study in this direction is advised. 
## C.2 A few topics (if even feasible)
Perhaps we can go for certain application:
- It is a valid consideration that **hyperspectral imaging** for a far-reaching sample might proves useful, since even though we have been heuristically, and blindly (somewhat) using CNN and its derived class, the data captured using Raman spectrometer is not utilized, or rather, too few to be utilized by the architecture itself. Granted, they are of the wavelet, signal-like system, but typical analysis in such aspect only leaves data in 1D, which is undesirable, and perhaps there are better alternatives than just plain CNN for various tasks. Though, data availability, data acquisition ability, and the cost of operation will eventually be a bigger concern. 
- Under the same concern, we think material science is the best. However, it is even more interesting if the subject of **crystalline materials**, other structured and complex materials, or **multi-layer material** with far and wide interpretation of data (for example, the data can be expanded to high-dimensional) is an interesting look. Furthermore, if able, perhaps even elemental crystal, or substances of structure can be used already in the process. Silicon and semiconductor-based materials or structure is also a pretty interesting application if able. 
- Another idea might be suggested. Since **Raman spectroscopy** is non-destructive, if allowed, we might be able to counter this by creating, or utilizing certain two-way system - one non-destructive, scanning and analyzing system of Raman spectroscopy, and one destructive modifying or mutating optical machines which takes in the data received and analyzed by Raman spectrometer, and takes actions specifically to alter the material or subject of interest. This might be utilized in error mitigation and quality processing and handling for materials, especially in an optical-only environment, like in lithographic processes.

Though focused on material science, it would be a waste to not also includes others application in accordance. 
## Clinical science
Application of Raman spectroscopy in clinical medicine [(Yaping et al., 2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.07740), most notably during the SARS-Cov19 pandemic has been particularly successful. Most application in this sense is on the study of *biological tissues, in/ex vivo samples analysis*, medication evaluation, surgery, and medical diagnosis. Applications of machine learning and AI in such aspect can be taken as the following table (reproduced from the paper):

As we can see, most algorithms used are standard, *classical machine learning* algorithm, with addition of CNN and normal image processing models. The form of the model specified however, is more complicated of analysis, but based on a few application, we can guess their form as the estimators $\theta$ in statistical learning setting. SARS-CoV-2 in the setting of Raman spectroscopy also focus on identification and screening, most of the time. 
# Appendix III - A review on deep learning and Raman spectroscopy
While we listed all those applications, subjects, and waypoints to choose, how about a concrete example? We review the work of Yaping et al. (2023), [Deep Learning Assisted Raman Spectroscopy for Rapid Identification of 2D Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01389). This comes along as a prototypical application of Raman spectroscopy - **on identifications**, here for 2D materials. 

First, some notes:
- **Dataset (in analysis)**: Pretty moderate, with the total amount of 594 spectra. That includes:


| Materials   | Quantity of spectra |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| BP          | 35                  |
| Graphene    | 209                 |
| $MoS_{2}$   | 8                   |
| $ReS_{{2}}$ | 15                  |
| Te          | 270                 |
| $WSe_{2}$   | 6                   |
| $WTe_{2}$   | 28                  |
| $S_{1}$     | 8                   |
| $S_{2}$     | 7                   |
| $S_{3}$     | 8                   |
| **Total**   | 594                 |



Which is not so much. Though, there seems to be relative abundance in certain type of material (Graphene and Te, perhaps for elements without difficulty of manufacturing?). 
- **The scope of model**: The model is pretty simple. Generally, since Raman spectrum is signal-like, or putting in such perspective, and the fact that as mentioned, machine learning requires *large dataset to work with*, it is inherent that they have to **scale up the dataset**. This is conducted using DDPM-based synthetic generation for each category of materials. Then, they provide the sample to a model comprises of a 4-layer CNN, more so of the particular **ResNet** architecture (quite popular, better than LeNet). 
Particularly, those type of deep learning application do not use any related techniques, or knowledge related to Raman spectroscopy, or optical physics in general. It seems to be the general theme for those researches, however: *they assumes no speciality*, and only use general method for processing general tasks.
