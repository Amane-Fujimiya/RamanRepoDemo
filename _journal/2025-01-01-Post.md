The story is short. So, we are trying to find some application for both:
- Raman spectroscopy - the spectroscopic method using *Raman scattering* for non-destructive spectral information.
- Machine learning - the hideous technique of black-box phenomenological modelling designed for learning from statistical setting, of ungodly amount of data, and is typically very good.
- And one more old horse in this slot.
The horse can be anything worth considering. Pharma? Well, unfortunately we do not have expertise on it, so that goes out of the window[^2]. Either way, so far it can only go toward that. Currently, there is a traction toward going for material science, which is pretty nice by the way - since after all, it all lies in one single field, but I am pretty much worried about how we will fare with it, while there are at least a few other topics of interest that have similar characteristic, just to say, like material science.

> When finding application related to Raman spectroscopy, one of the main problem that we have to take into account is the **cost** of the entire setup, plus, the feasibility of obtaining samples, spectral data, and the time acquisition of those goods that we actually want. Hence, that dictates what is available.

But oh well, let's see what can we do about this problem.
# A. The problem of criteria
Because it is multidiscipline, we have to make up the dimensional criteria analysis (a fancier name for *pick anything, but make it works fairly well for all things considered*) which satisfies the requirement of utilizing the physical technique (Raman scattering), the acting model (machine learning), and applying it to the topic of interest (still the old horse). 

So, what constitute the choices? Based on at least current knowledge, we can summarize them as followed.

| Raman spectroscopic method (Optical physics)       | Raman spectroscopy is fairly limited, in what can it affect. However, it is not limited in how can it be utilized. Certainly, for Raman scattering and spectroscopy, we need to know: <br>- What *type* of Raman spectroscopy are we talking about? Is it Resonance Raman (RRS), Surface-enhanced Raman (SER), or else? <br>- What *type* of data do we expect from those application or use cases? <br>- What is the interpretation of the experiment, the setting, and hence, the Raman scattering effect according to such setting?<br>- How hard it is to obtain a Raman sample (spectrum, etc.) for a given task? How much time do you have to make a sample, how much effort goes into it, how scalable is the sample acquisition process? Or rather, **how many data can we get, feasibly, and how easy can that be (or reverse)?**<br>- How many factors can be taken into account which might lead to sample degradation, sample contamination, etc. that ultimately affects how the experiment goes? <br>- How **costly** it is? What is the cost for operating them?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | The issue with interpretation is prominent. However, it seems like the general consensus focuses on the costs more so likely than that. Especially so, since a Raman spectroscopic unit is very costly (smallest one costs $4000). |
| Machine learning and artificial intelligence       | For machine learning, we have two approaches. Or rather, in the sense of *mathematical modelling*. Either **phenomenological** or **mechanistic** modelling can be performed. What does this means is that one is a *statistical* - purely observational without priori of knowledge about the mechanics behind it, and one models the mechanics of what operates under the curtain. By doing so, we set ourselves a fairly bit of requirements, for minimum: <br>- (Optional) A comprehensive study or availability to gain partial knowledge of the internal mechanics of the system in analysis (optical physics-specific knowledge might apply)<br>- Phenomenologically, settings and consideration of **large dataset**, **data availability**, **data interpretability**, and overall *how easy it is to analyze the data, gather the data*? <br>- Computational complexity: just how much will a certain task costs, and how can it be performed, either pre-training, or after-training? This will inevitably costs you application, for example, high computational complexity for edge device is undesirable. <br>- Architecture: What type of architecture, either phenomenological or mechanistic modelling will you use? <br>- Goal: What is the **intended goal**? Is the goal or final objective valid of applying machine learning? Are there any specific classical method that works well without using machine learning or artificial intelligence-aid method? <br>- Cost: How much will it costs, in operating, training, setting up? | The problem of cost is substantial, but not nearly as important as what of Raman spectroscopy.                                                                                                                                     |
| Certain topics (for now, it is *material science*) | Now, for certain topic, they have to satisfy all those above. Then comes down here for a bit of criteria. <br>- How much data and support that one specific topic has for both Raman spectroscopy and ML/AI? <br>- What has been done, what is the main angle of utilization the above topic used in the field? <br>- Does optical physics have places, or applications that can utilize specialized knowledge of optical physics in said field?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |


To full realize those criteria, we then have to analyze them, bit by bit. 
# I. Raman spectroscopy
Raman scattering is an *optical* effect. Or, just so much saying that it is produced by shooting lights in some way, and get something in return. 

First, for Raman spectroscopy, its characteristic dictates what can we do with it. And to be honest, not so much. Raman spectroscopy as recalled, relies on **Raman scattering** effect, which is a non-destructive phenomenon on materials and matters. So is to say that it does practically nothing on the specimen we use to obtain the data, hence, it is pretty good and a nice choice for analysing stuff that you are concerned of that is not, well, suitable for being destroyed figuratively so much.

An interesting property of Raman scattering is the dual nature of it with IR spectrum. Under the vibration mode interpretation of Raman effect, some phonon (the vibrating 'packet') is IR-active while Roman-inactive, and so forth. Though, under a detailed analysis we can see that there are also *silent mode*, where both are inactive.

One of its main potential, from the early day when someone of the same name used solar ray to facilitate the effect is the *fingerprinting property* of Raman spectroscopic method. That is, any given matter will have its own **distinct** Raman spectrum. This leads to the application of *material identification*, *filtering*, *impurities classification (analysis)*, and else that make use specifically the property. Well, a lot of them. But there are also more than just that. Well, let's see for the most normal one.
## Applications of Raman spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy is mentioned to be particularly effective, if not widely used in material sciences with their successes. We first review some of the general applications first, in which there are plenty.

Thus, lead to the analysis of valuable, unattainable objects of interest and decomposition of such specimen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Polymers and emulsions** | A very early application. We have seen this a lot, which there exists a ten-chapter report on vibrational analysis of polymers with Raman spectroscopy (who is that mad lad?). Polymers have been studied for identification, structure, composition, cure and degree of polymerization in the solid, melt, film and emulsion states.<br><br>Aside from polymers themselves, they are also used to study polymer composites.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|         **Colour**         | Comes of a bit surprising, but Raman spectroscopy is *inherently weird* in the sense that it is very sensitive to coloured molecules. Furthermore, it can overcome the fluorescence effect when analyzing coloured molecules using visible light, for example. Well, if you want a career in dyes or color, there you go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|      **Electronics**       | **Here's the fun part**. It's actually pretty short. <br><br>Colour (right above) can be used effectively in *electronic devices*, for example, to provide a detector or to produce an image; thus making the *selectivity* of resonance Raman scattering (a type of Raman spectroscopy) a good color probe for those electrophotography dyes. <br><br>Materials, those type that when charge generating drum is examined by Raman spectroscopy gives off the bands from phthalocyanine and other non-colour element, aside from being used in bulk, copier or printer drums, are also employed as very thin films or coating in organic semiconductors, and LED. The ability to *carry out microscopic* or *in situ* examination allows the study of these materials in the devices in which they are used. <br><br>Aside from the fancy organic semi, we also have traditional semiconductors in use. Elements like *carbon, germanium and silicon* are analyzed by Raman spectroscopy for quality control, for a lot of interpretation of the data. For semiconducting crystals and superconducting crystal (like BSCCO or YBCO), Raman spectroscopy can provides structural characterization, lattices information and crystal behaviours. |
|        **Forensic**        | Okay, so, catching crimes. Not the best one in the list, but anyway. Modern developments in equipment for the detection of Raman scattering make the method very useful in the area of forensic science. The main culprit for this, is as always, the fact that it is non-invasive, non-contact method. The rest follows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |


Those are some typical normal application for Raman spectroscopy [^1]. Now, that is all good, but what about specifically *material science*? We found specifically some of the same interest. But what is the specific application for material sciences and its 'relating' in a sense field: Well, we identified several interesting application for a lot of them:

| Material science | Energetic materials<br>Amorphous materials<br> | Raman spectroscopy is especially useful in material sciences, for the following:<br>- Analysis of different material (Cantarero, 2014): Ge quantum wires, inorganic or organic materials; material identification of basic characterization, for example, in *amorphous materials* (glass, for example), or characterization of GaN quantum dots. More serious, advanced analysis setting is on the analysis of *layers material* (Ni et al. (2008), Sorkin (2014)) in, for example, bulk graphite (HOPG). In the context of **earth and material science** in conjunction, such materials in analysis expanded to *crystalline spectra* (Silicon's Silica polmorphs and amorphous SiO2), quartz, generally *amorphous materials*, aluminosilicate glasses, and else, are in the list. <br><br>- **Optical effects**: Materials can have various effect observable by Raman spectroscopy. For example, isotopic effect can be extracted meaningfully using Raman frequency [Windulle et al. (1999)] for Ge decomposition. Another effect observable is the *surface optical phonons*, where the bulk materials surface produces visible new phonon modes related to the surface, which plays a large roles for few layers of materials, or quantum wires of low-dimension. In such case, Raman can be used to extract meaningful information [Cantarero (2013), Moller et al. (2011)] about the TO, and LO phonon.<br><br>- **Electronic density** of states can also be analyzed, for doped semiconductor, which gives the *electron concentration* of a semiconducting material, for example, in a book chapter of Klein (1998) on GaAs. Silicon can be doped much more than such, and hence, another way for Raman spectra here to be observed, or extracted, is during the process of **energy concentration increment**: because then, at some point the electronic background will interferes with the phonon, and the shape of the phonon deviates from typical profile, giving the **Fano line-shape** for all kind of excitation spectra. This is more thoroughly studied in [Belitsky et al. (1997)] treatment on the theory of Raman scattering due to interaction of phonons with electronic background.<br><br>- **In situ Raman spectroscopy**: For material science, it is weirdly popular of a choice to include in situ Raman application. Not surprising afterward however, since *in situ* Raman spectroscopy can be performed at high temperature, high pressure, it can be used to investigate dynamic processes at high temperature or pressure, as reported by [Neuville et al. (2014)]. An illustrative example is shown by having boron oxygen coordinate being examined over high temperature changes. This perspective of time-series, multiple Raman layers also fits with what can be called **hyperspectral Raman imaging** as mentioned above. | Generally, Raman spectroscopy now is used in quality control, sensors, and else, instead of the classical usage of in-laboratory setting. |
|                  |                                                | - **Hyperspectral imaging**: Another common application for Raman spectroscopy is creating *hyperspectral images*. To accomplish this, the focal volume is scanned across the sample, via either moving the optics or translating the sample itself. Each pixel is associated with a Raman spectrum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                           |



Some conclusion are made from papers and experts on usage of Raman spectroscopy in those applications: 
1. The **obvious one** of why we are doing this topic: The lack of interactive database, or interpretation of large data. This is cited to be the main difficulties with Raman spectroscopy application, since the absence of such feature leads to difficulties with analysis and, again, interpretation of data. Furthermore, the data being interpreted is very *limited*, in a sense. For example, RRUFF database for mineralogical community is very useful, but also limited since one needs to have priori knowledge about chemical composition of the material to work on it. In situation in which that is hard to figure out, well... go figure.
