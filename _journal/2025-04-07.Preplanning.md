The story is short. So, we are trying to find some application for both: 
- Raman spectroscopy - the spectroscopic method using *Raman scattering* for non-destructive spectral information. 
- Machine learning - the hideous technique of black-box phenomenological modelling designed for learning from statistical setting, of ungodly amount of data, and is typically very good. 
- And one more old horse in this slot. 

The horse can be anything worth considering. Pharma? Well, unfortunately we do not have expertises on it, so that goes out of the window[^1]. Either way, so far it can only go toward that. Currently, there is a traction toward going for material science, which is pretty nice by the way - since after all, it all lies in one single field, but I am pretty much worried about how we will fare with it, while there are at least a few other topics of interest that have similar characteristic, just to say, like material science.

> When finding application related to Raman spectroscopy, one of the main problem that we have to take into account is the **cost** of the entire setup, plus, the feasibility of obtaining samples, spectral data, and the time acquisition of those goods that we actually want. Hence, that dictates what is available. 

But oh well, let's see what can we do about this problem.
## A. The problem of criteria
Because it is multidiscipline, we have to make up the dimensional criteria analysis (a fancier name for *pick anything, but make it works fairly well for all things considered*) which satisfies the requirement of utilizing the physical technique (Raman scattering), the acting model (machine learning), and applying it to the topic of interest (still the old horse). So what do we have?

### Raman spectroscopy

Raman scattering is an optical effect. Or, just so much saying that it is produced by shooting lights in some way, and get something in return. 

First, for Raman spectroscopy, its characteristic dictates what can we do with it. And to be honest, not so much. Raman spectroscopy as recalled, relies on **Raman scattering** effect, which is a non-destructive phenomenon on materials and matters. So is to say that it does practically nothing on the specimen we use to obtain the data, hence, it is pretty good and a nice choice for analysing stuff that you are concerned of that is not, well, suitable for being destroyed figuratively so much. 

An interesting property of Raman scattering is the dual nature of it with IR spectrum. Under the vibration mode interpretation of Raman effect, some phonon (the vibrating 'packet') is IR-active while Roman-inactive, and so forth. Though, under a detailed analysis we can see that there are also *silent mode*, where both are inactive. 

One of its main potential, from the early day when someone of the same name used solar ray to facilitate the effect is the *fingerprinting property* of Raman spectroscopic method. That is, any given matter will have its own **distinct** Raman spectrum. This leads to the application of *material identification*, *filtering*, *impurities classification (analysis)*, and else that make use specifically the property. Well, a lot of them. But there are also more than just that. Well, let's see for the most normal one.

| **Art and archaeology**    | Non-destructive samples analysis is one of the key strength here. Furthermore, it also requires very small sample, *microsample* or by confocal techniques. Thus, lead to the analysis of valuable, unattainable objects of interest and decomposition of such specimen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Polymers and emulsions** | A very early application. We have seen this a lot, which there exists a ten-chapter report on vibrational analysis of polymers with Raman spectroscopy (who is that mad lad?). Polymers have been studied for identification, structure, composition, cure and degree of polymerization in the solid, melt, film and emulsion states.<br><br>Aside from polymers themselves, they are also used to study polymer composites.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Colour**                 | Comes of a bit surprising, but Raman spectroscopy is *inherently weird* in the sense that it is very sensitive to coloured molecules. Furthermore, it can overcome the fluorescence effect when analyzing coloured molecules using visible light, for example. Well, if you want a career in dyes or color, there you go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Electronics**            | **Here's the fun part**. It's actually pretty short. <br><br>Colour (right above) can be used effectively in *electronic devices*, for example, to provide a detector or to produce an image; thus making the *selectivity* of resonance Raman scattering (a type of Raman spectroscopy) a good color probe for those electrophotography dyes. <br><br>Materials, those type that when charge generating drum is examined by Raman spectroscopy gives off the bands from phthalocyanine and other non-colour element, aside from being used in bulk, copier or printer drums, are also employed as very thin films or coating in organic semiconductors, and LED. The ability to *carry out microscopic* or *in situ* examination allows the study of these materials in the devices in which they are used. <br><br>Aside from the fancy organic semi, we also have traditional semiconductors in use. Elements like *carbon, germanium and silicon* are analyzed by Raman spectroscopy for quality control, for a lot of interpretation of the data. For semiconducting crystals and superconducting crystal (like BSCCO or YBCO), Raman spectroscopy can provides structural characterization, lattices information and crystal behaviours. |
| **Forensic**               | Okay, so, catching crimes. Not the best one in the list, but anyway. Modern developments in equipment for the detection of Raman scattering make the method very useful in the area of forensic science. The main culprit for this, is as always, the fact that it is non-invasive, non-contact method. The rest follows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Now, that is all good. For now.


[^1]: Truth to be told, it is surprising at best, but other than the lack of expertise, it is also the *tiresome waiting time* if we are to cooperate with any third-party institute, for example, on Raman spectroscopic method for medical research or manufacturing.
